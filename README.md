Hello, my name is Nicholas.

The WPFRegisterStudent application was made in accordance with SNHU's guidelines. It stores information about 
courses, like the name and registered status, and refers to that information. It only exits the application 
when a student prompts it to. It displays accurate information, and has accurate error displays as well.

I believe I did everything fairly well. It was well formatted, readable code, executed in the best way I 
knew how to accomplish the intended goal.

I approached it from the most natural way I could. I visualized in my mind the tasks which needed to be done,
in order to achieve the end effect. I don't really know how to answer that question. I simply made the code,
not really paying mind to technique or strategy.

Innovative is not a word I would use to describe. Compartmentalize the problem down into smaller tasks, building
up to the completion of the project. It's not innovative, but it helped me overcome challenges.

I also threw in the Lair's Dice app I made in C++, because I like to gloat.

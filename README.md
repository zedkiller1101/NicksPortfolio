Hello, my name is Nicholas.

I am a nerd of many trades, who dabbles in most corners of nerddom.
I first got into video games when my father won a PS2 from a Pepsi cap, and ever since I've been an avid gamer.
I seek to find work making the games I dreamed to play as a boy.
I am a Marine Corps brat, who has seen much of the country (U.S.), and some of the world as well.
